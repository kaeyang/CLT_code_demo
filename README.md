# CLT_code_demo

This is a code demonstration of how Central Limit Theorem applies to a real-world dataset. We use the dataset From here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices 

We look at the population column and find that it has a right-skewed unimodal distribution that is not normal. We would take 1000 random samples of increasing sample size and observe that the sampling distribution gradually approahces a normal distribution.
